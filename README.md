## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Code generation failed?**
```bash
# Try simpler requirements
✅ "Jarvis, write simple Python web server"

# Or be more specific
✅ "Jarvis, write Flask server with 2 routes"
```

**Error fix not working?**
```bash
# Use recreate instead
✅ "Jarvis, recreate server.py"

# Or let AI learn from manual fix
# Fix manually, then: "Jarvis, analyze and learn from server.py"
```

**Wake word not detected?**
```bash
# Make sure to say "Jarvis" first
✅ "Jarvis, YouTube kholo"
❌ "YouTube kholo"
```

**Apps not opening?**
```bash
# Now fixed! Works on Windows/Mac/Linux
# Make sure app is installed
```

**Game not responding to AI?**
```bash
# Run as administrator (Windows)
# Grant accessibility permissions (Mac)
# See AI_GAME_PLAYER_GUIDE.md for details
```

**More help:** See [FIXES.md](FIXES.md) and [SELF_CODING_AI_GUIDE.md](SELF_CODING_AI_GUIDE.md)
